# Book_Genre_Classifier

# A model using TD-IDF to predict the genre of 3000 books based on their summary.

Created a function to check the frequency of words in a summary, Since there are numerous stopwords, they were removed and the more useful and meaningful words were left in order to determine the genre of the book
